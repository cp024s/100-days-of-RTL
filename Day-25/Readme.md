## In this Verilog module:

- `data_in` is the 8-bit input data that you want to shift.
- `shift_amount` is a 3-bit control signal that determines how many positions to shift.
- `shift_direction` is a control signal that specifies the shifting direction (0 for left, 1 for right).
- `data_out` is the 8-bit output data after shifting.

The `always` block uses a `case` statement to determine the shift direction and amount and calculates the `shifted_data` accordingly. Left shifting is performed using the `<<` operator, and right shifting is done using the `>>` operator.

## In this testbench:

- We declare the necessary signals for connecting to the shifter module: `data_in`, `shift_amount`, `shift_direction`, and `data_out`.

- We instantiate the `ParallelShifter` module and connect its ports to the testbench signals.

- Inside the `initial` block, we create test cases by changing the values of `data_in`, `shift_amount`, and `shift_direction`. We wait for some time using `#10` to allow the shifter to perform the shift operation, and then we compare the `data_out` with the expected output values.

- You can add more test cases by following the same pattern, and the testbench will display whether each test case passes or fails.
