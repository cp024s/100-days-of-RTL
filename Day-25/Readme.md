## In this Verilog module:

- `data_in` is the 8-bit input data that you want to shift.
- `shift_amount` is a 3-bit control signal that determines how many positions to shift.
- `shift_direction` is a control signal that specifies the shifting direction (0 for left, 1 for right).
- `data_out` is the 8-bit output data after shifting.

The `always` block uses a `case` statement to determine the shift direction and amount and calculates the `shifted_data` accordingly. Left shifting is performed using the `<<` operator, and right shifting is done using the `>>` operator.

You can instantiate this module in your Verilog design and connect it to other components as needed. Make sure to verify and simulate the behavior of this module using a Verilog simulator to ensure it meets your specific requirements.
