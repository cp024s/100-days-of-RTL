# DataTypeVerification


- Variables of different logic data types are declared.
- The `initial` block is used to initialize these variables with sample values.
- The `$display` system task is used to print the initial values of the variables.
- An `assert` statement is used to check if `myBit` is equal to 1. If it's not, a fatal error is triggered.
