## In this code:

- `RAM_4x4` is the name of the module.
- `address` is a 2-bit input that specifies the memory location to read from or write to.
- `write_enable` is a control signal that enables or disables write operations.
- `data_input` is a 4-bit input used for writing data into the memory.
- `data_output` is a 4-bit output that provides the data read from the memory.

The memory is implemented as an array of 4-bit registers (`memory`) with four locations (0 to 3). The `always` block is sensitive to positive edges of both `write_enable` and `address`. When `write_enable` is asserted, it writes `data_input` into the specified memory location. When `write_enable` is not asserted, it reads data from the specified memory location and drives it to `data_output`.
