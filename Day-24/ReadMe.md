## In this code:

- `RAM_4x4` is the name of the module.
- `address` is a 2-bit input that specifies the memory location to read from or write to.
- `write_enable` is a control signal that enables or disables write operations.
- `data_input` is a 4-bit input used for writing data into the memory.
- `data_output` is a 4-bit output that provides the data read from the memory.

The memory is implemented as an array of 4-bit registers (`memory`) with four locations (0 to 3). The `always` block is sensitive to positive edges of both `write_enable` and `address`. When `write_enable` is asserted, it writes `data_input` into the specified memory location. When `write_enable` is not asserted, it reads data from the specified memory location and drives it to `data_output`.

## In this Test bench:

- The `RAM_4x4` module is instantiated, and its inputs and outputs are connected.
- A clock signal is generated with a 10-unit time period.
- The testbench initializes the `address`, `write_enable`, and `data_input` signals.
- It first writes data (1101) to the RAM at address 01 and then reads the data from the same address.
- Finally, it checks whether the data output matches the expected value and prints a pass or fail message accordingly.

## 8x4 RAM using 4x4 RAM - In this code:

- The `RAM_8x4` module has a 3-bit address input, which is used to address four 4x4 RAM modules.
- Two 2-bit addresses, `addr1` and `ddr2`, are derived from the 3-bit address to select the appropriate RAM modules.
- Four instances of the 4x4 RAM module (`RAM1` and `RAM2`) are instantiated to store and retrieve data.
- The outputs from the 4x4 RAM modules are multiplexed based on the 3-bit address to generate the 8x4 RAM's output data.
- You can use this `RAM_8x4` module in your Verilog design by connecting the address, write enable, data input, and data output signals as needed. Adjust the multiplexing logic inside the always block if you have different requirements for addressing or data organization.
