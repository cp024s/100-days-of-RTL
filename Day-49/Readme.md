## In this Verilog code:

- `data_in` is the 4-bit input data to be encoded.
- `crc_out` is the 7-bit CRC-encoded output.
- `crc_reg` is a 4-bit shift register that stores the current CRC value.
- `divisor` is the polynomial used for the CRC calculation.

The `always` block describes the behavior of the CRC encoder. It performs the XOR operation between the current CRC value (`crc_reg`) and the input data (`data_in`) while shifting the CRC register. The polynomial division is performed based on the value of the most significant bit of the CRC register.

Make sure to include proper clock (`clk`) and reset (`reset`) signals in your overall Verilog design and connect them to this module as needed. Additionally, ensure that you choose the appropriate polynomial for your CRC encoding requirements. The polynomial used in this example (x^3 + x^2 + 1) is just one possibility, and you may need to change it to match your specific application.

## In this Verilog code:

- `received_data` is the 7-bit received data, which includes the 4-bit data and the 3-bit CRC.
- `valid` is an output signal that indicates whether the received data is valid (CRC check passed).

The decoder works by performing the same CRC calculation as the encoder. It shifts the received CRC bits (from `received_data[6:4]`) and XORs them with the calculated CRC using the same polynomial (`divisor`). If the final value of `crc_reg` is all zeros, the `valid` signal is set to 1, indicating that the received data is valid.

Again, make sure to include the necessary clock (`clk`) and reset (`reset`) signals in your overall Verilog design and connect them to this module as needed.
