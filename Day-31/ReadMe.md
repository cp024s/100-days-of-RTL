## In this code:

- The `ripple_carry_adder` module takes two 32-bit inputs `A` and `B` and produces a 32-bit sum output `sum` along with the carry-out `carry_out`.

- We use a generate loop to instantiate 32 instances of the `full_adder` module, connecting them in a ripple carry fashion. Each instance of the `full_adder` module computes the sum and carry-out for one bit position.

- The `full_adder` module takes three inputs `A`, `B`, and `Ci` (carry-in) and produces two outputs `S` (sum) and `Co` (carry-out).

This code models a 32-bit ripple carry adder using full adders, which is a simple but slow method of adding two numbers. For more efficient addition of large numbers, you might consider using other adder structures like a carry-lookahead adder or carry-skip adder.

## In this simplified testbench, we have two test cases:

1. Case 1 tests the addition of `0xABCDEF01` and `0x12345678`.
2. Case 2 tests the addition of `0xFFFFFFFF` and `0x00000001`.

You can add more test cases by following a similar structure. Each case sets the input values `A` and `B`, waits for some simulation time to allow the computation to finish, and then displays the results.

Make sure to extend the testbench with more test cases and adjust the initial values of `A` and `B` as needed to cover the desired scenarios.
