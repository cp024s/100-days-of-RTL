## In this Verilog module:

- `inputs` is an N-bit vector representing the N input signals to be prioritized.
- `output` is an N-bit vector representing the highest priority input. Only one bit will be set in this vector, indicating the highest priority input.

Inside the `always` block, the module iterates through each input signal and checks if it's asserted (high). If an asserted input is found and no higher priority input has been found yet (indicated by `priority_output` being 0), it sets the corresponding bit in `priority_output`. This ensures that the highest priority input is selected.

Finally, the `assign` statement assigns the `priority_output` to the `output` port.
