## In this Verilog module:

- `inputs` is an N-bit vector representing the N input signals to be prioritized.
- `output` is an N-bit vector representing the highest priority input. Only one bit will be set in this vector, indicating the highest priority input.

Inside the `always` block, the module iterates through each input signal and checks if it's asserted (high). If an asserted input is found and no higher priority input has been found yet (indicated by `priority_output` being 0), it sets the corresponding bit in `priority_output`. This ensures that the highest priority input is selected.

Finally, the `assign` statement assigns the `priority_output` to the `output` port.

## In this testbench:

1. We define a parameter `N` to specify the number of inputs (set to 3 in this example).

2. We instantiate the `PriorityResolver` module and connect its inputs and output.

3. In the `initial` block, we use a `for` loop to test all possible input combinations for 3 inputs (0 to 7 in binary).

4. We monitor the `inputs` and `output` signals at each simulation time step.

5. We introduce a delay of 10 time units after each input combination change to allow time for the output to settle.

6. Finally, we use `$finish` to end the simulation.

You can modify the `N` parameter to match the number of inputs in your specific priority resolver design. Please note that for a large number of inputs, testing all possible combinations may not be practical due to the exponential growth in the number of combinations. In such cases, you might consider using random testing or selecting a representative subset of test cases.
