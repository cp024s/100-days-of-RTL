## In this Verilog code:

`counter` is a 4-bit register that holds the state of the ring counter.

The `always` block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock ( `posedge clk` ) and the rising edge of the reset signal ( `posedge rst` ).

When the `reset` signal (rst) is asserted, the counter is initialized to `4'b0001`.

When not in reset, the counter is shifted one position to the left ( `counter << 1` ), and the MSB (Most Significant Bit) is connected to the LSB (Least Significant Bit) to create the ring effect.

The `assign` statement assigns the current state of the `counter` register to the output `out`.

You can modify the number of bits by changing the bit width of the `counter` and `out` signals.

## In this testbench:

We instantiate the `Ring_Counter_tb.v` module and connect its ports to signals within the testbench.

We generate a clock signal ( `clk` ) with a 50% duty cycle. The clock signal alternates between 0 and 1 with a delay of 5 time units between transitions.

We initialize the `rst` signal to 1 for 10 time units to reset the counter and then set it to 0 to start counting.

The `$display` and `$monitor` statements are used to display the time and the state of the ring counter at each time step.

The simulation runs for 20 clock cycles ( `#100` time units) and then finishes.
