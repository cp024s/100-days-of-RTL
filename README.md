# 100-days-of-RTL
probable journey of RTL coding ft. Chandra Prakash


I am chandra Prakash S, a VLSI enthusiast and this is my journey of 100 days of RTL (Verilog, System verilog, UVM). 
I mostly use Questasim software for the simulation of RTL Codes and the Synthesis is performed by using Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.
