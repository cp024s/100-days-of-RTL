# 100 Days of RTL Design Journey

Welcome to the "100 Days of RTL Design Journey" repository! This is a personal challenge aimed at improving our RTL (Register Transfer Level) design skills and becoming proficient in digital hardware design. Throughout this journey, we will dedicate 100 consecutive days to learn, practice, and create RTL designs for various digital circuits.

## Introduction

RTL Design is a crucial aspect of digital hardware design, where we describe the behavior of digital circuits using hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL. This repository is a personal commitment to dive deep into the world of RTL design, sharpen our skills, and become proficient in creating efficient and robust digital circuits.


## Progress

Track our progress through the 100 days in this section. Below, you can find a table or list that will be regularly updated with the day number, design description, and links to each day's RTL design folder.

| Day | Design Description | Link |
|----|--------------------|------|
| 1  |                    | [Day 1](day1/) |
| 2                       | [Day 2](day2/) |
| 3  |                    | ...  |

## Resources

During this journey, we can refer to various resources to enhance our understanding and improve our RTL design skills. Here are some recommended resources:

- Book: ["Digital Design with an introduction to Verilog HDL" by Morris mano and Michael D. Clietti]((https://www.portcity.edu.bd/files/636444791235373856_Digitallogicdesign.pdf))
- [Online Course: " System Design Through Verilog" by Prof. Shaik rafi Ahamed](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc23_ee88/course)
