In this code, the `hamming_code_generator` module takes a 4-bit data input and generates a 7-bit codeword with 3 parity bits and 4 data bits. The parity bits are calculated using XOR gates to ensure that the resulting codeword has the correct Hamming code properties.

Please note that this code represents a simplified example and does not include additional features like error correction. In practice, Hamming codes are used not only for error detection but also for error correction. Error correction would require more complex logic to identify and correct errors in the received codeword.
