## In this Verilog Code

In this Verilog module, we have two data ports (`data_out1` and `data_out2`) for reading data from the memory and two write enable signals (`write_en1` and `write_en2`) for writing data to the memory. 

The module includes an 8-bit wide memory array `memory`, and each port has an 8-bit address bus (`addr1` and `addr2`) and an 8-bit data bus (`data_in1` and `data_in2`).

The module performs read and write operations based on the clock signal (`clk`) and an optional reset signal (`rst`). 

When a write operation is enabled for a specific port, the data is written to the corresponding address in the memory array. When a read operation is requested, the data is read from the memory and provided on the respective data output port. When a write operation is not enabled, the data output is in a high-impedance state (8'bZ).

## In this Test bench

1. We instantiate the `two_port_ram` module and generate a clock signal (`clk`) with a period of 10 time units.

2. We apply initial values to the inputs, including a reset (`rst`) signal.

3. We perform write operations by changing the address, data inputs, and write enables for both ports.

4. We then read data from the memory by setting the write enables to 0 and monitoring the data outputs.

5. Finally, we use `$finish` to end the simulation and display the results at each time step using `$display`.
