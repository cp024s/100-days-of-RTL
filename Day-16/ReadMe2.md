# Encoder Module

## Overview

The Encoder module is a digital circuit implemented in Verilog that performs the function of encoding a set of input signals into a coded output representation. This README provides an overview of the Encoder module, its purpose, input/output specifications, and usage.

## Purpose

An encoder is a critical component in digital systems, commonly used for various purposes, including data compression, data transmission, and control applications. The Encoder module provided here is a general-purpose 4-to-2 encoder.

## Input Specifications

The Encoder module accepts the following input signals:

- `data_in` (4-bit input): This input represents the data that needs to be encoded.

## Output Specifications

The Encoder module generates the following output signals:

- `data_out` (2-bit output): This output represents the encoded data, which is a compressed or coded representation of the input data.

## Module Implementation

The core of the Encoder module is its encoding logic. In this specific implementation, the encoding logic uses the logical OR operation to compress the input data. Specifically, it computes the logical OR of the bits in the input signal within specific ranges.

## Usage

To use the Encoder module in your Verilog project, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the Encoder module in your top-level module or testbench.
2. Connect the `data_in` input of the Encoder to your input data signals.
3. Connect the `data_out` output of the Encoder to your desired output signals.
4. Ensure that the Verilog file containing the Encoder module is included in your project.

# Decoder

## Overview

A decoder is a fundamental digital logic circuit that plays a critical role in various digital systems. It is used to decode coded inputs into specific output signals, allowing for the interpretation of data or the selection of specific actions based on the input code.

## How It Works

At its core, a decoder functions by taking a coded input and activating one or more specific output lines based on the input code. The input code is typically in binary format, but it can also be in other coded formats depending on the application.

The key components and steps involved in the operation of a decoder include:

1. **Coded Input:** The decoder takes a coded input, which represents data, commands, or addresses. This input is processed by the decoder to determine the corresponding action or output.

2. **Decoding Logic:** Inside the decoder, there is a specific decoding logic circuit. This logic circuit interprets the coded input and generates control signals that activate the appropriate output lines.

3. **Output Signals:** The output of the decoder consists of one or more signals, often in the form of binary digits (0s and 1s). These output signals represent the decoded information or control actions.

4. **Applications:** Decoders have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:
   - Memory Address Decoding: In computer memory systems, decoders are used to select specific memory locations based on memory addresses.
   - Control Signal Generation: In microcontrollers and digital control systems, decoders are used to generate control signals based on command codes.
   - Data Retrieval: In data retrieval systems, decoders are used to access specific data items based on codes or addresses.

5. **Types of Decoders:** There are several types of decoders, each designed for specific applications. Common types include:
   - Binary Decoder: Converts binary input codes into one of multiple output lines.
   - BCD to 7-Segment Decoder: Converts Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) input into a format suitable for driving a 7-segment display.
   - Priority Decoder: Selects the highest-priority input line that is active and generates an output based on its position.
   - Address Decoder: Selects a specific memory location or peripheral device based on an address code.

## Usage

To use a decoder, you typically need to provide the coded input to the decoder circuit and observe or utilize the generated output signals. The specific implementation and connections may vary depending on the decoder type and the application it serves.
