Converting Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) to Excess-3 (XS-3) in Verilog involves creating a digital circuit that takes a BCD input and produces the corresponding XS-3 output. XS-3 is a binary-coded representation of BCD in which each BCD digit is incremented by 3.

In this example, we assume that the bcd_in input is a 4-bit BCD representation, and xs3_out is the 4-bit Excess-3 output.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:
Declare a module called bcd_to_excess3 with inputs bcd_in and outputs xs3_out.
Declare a wire bcd_plus_3 to hold the BCD input incremented by 3.
Use an assign statement to increment the bcd_in by adding the binary value 0011 (which is 3 in binary) to it, resulting in bcd_plus_3.
Finally, assign xs3_out to be equal to bcd_plus_3, as the XS-3 representation is the same as the incremented BCD.
