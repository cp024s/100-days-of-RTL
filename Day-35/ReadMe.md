## In this code:

1. We use a 16-bit counter (`count`) to divide the input clock frequency by 32768. The counter counts from 0 to 32767 and then resets, creating an even division of the input clock.

2. The most significant bit of the counter (`count[15]`) is used as the toggle signal. It will go high when the counter reaches its maximum value and toggle back to low when it resets.

3. The output signal `even_freq_out` is assigned to the `toggle` signal, creating a square wave with an even frequency.

Make sure to adjust the counter size or divisor as needed to achieve your desired output frequency. The output frequency in this example will be half of the input clock frequency.
