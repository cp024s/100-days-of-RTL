## In this Verilog module:

- `num` is a 32-bit input representing the number you want to check for primality.
- `is_prime` is a 1-bit output that indicates whether the input number is prime (1) or not (0).

The module uses sequential logic to check for primality. It initializes `i` to 2 and `is_prime_internal` to 1 (assuming the number is prime) when the circuit is reset (`rst` is asserted). Then, in each clock cycle, it checks if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by `i`, it sets `is_prime_internal` to 0 (indicating that the number is not prime). If not, it increments `i`.

The final `assign` statement checks if the input number is greater than 1 (since 0 and 1 are not prime) and returns the value of `is_prime_internal`. If the input number is less than or equal to 1, it directly outputs 0 as those numbers are not prime by definition.

## In this Verilog testbench:

- We instantiate the `PrimeChecker` module and connect its inputs and outputs.

- We generate a clock signal (`clk`) using an `always` block.

- We initialize the testbench, set the reset signal (`rst`) to 0, and provide different input numbers (`num`) to test various cases.

- For each test case, we assert the reset signal (`rst`) to reset the Prime Checker module, wait for a few clock cycles, deassert `rst`, and then check the `is_prime` output. We use the `$display` statement to print the test results.
