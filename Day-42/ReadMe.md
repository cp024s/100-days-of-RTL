## In this Verilog module, 

we have an 8-point ButterflyUnit that takes eight complex input values (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) and a 3-bit control signal to select between addition and subtraction operations for each pair of inputs. The real and imaginary parts of the inputs are added or subtracted based on the control signal, and the results are stored in `temp_real` and `temp_imag`.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real FFT implementation, you would have multiple stages of Butterfly Units and more complex control logic to perform the FFT computation on a sequence of data points. The bit widths and complexities of the operations may also vary based on the specific FFT algorithm and the precision required for your application.
