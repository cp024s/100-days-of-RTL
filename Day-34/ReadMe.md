## In this code:

- `clk` is the clock input.
- `rst` is the reset input, which allows you to reset the counter.
- `out` is the output frequency signal, which toggles at the specified frequency.

You should replace `odd_number` with the odd number you want to use for frequency generation. This code will create a simple counter that increments by 1 each clock cycle until it reaches `odd_number - 1`, at which point it will reset and toggle the output signal.
