## In this Verilog code:

- `clk` is the clock input.
- `reset` is the reset input.
- `x` is the input signal to detect the sequence "101."
- `y` is the output signal that will be '1' when the sequence is detected, and '0' otherwise.

The code defines a 3-bit sequence detector using the Moore model. It has four states (`S0` to `S3`), where `S3` represents the state when the "101" sequence is detected. The output `y` is set to '1' only when the sequence is detected in state `S3`. The FSM transitions through these states based on the input signal `x`. The sequence detector resets to `S0` when the `reset` signal is asserted.

## In this testbench:

- We instantiate the `sequence_detector_moore` module and connect its inputs and outputs.
- We generate a clock signal (`clk`) that toggles every 5 time units.
- We define four test cases:
  1. Reset and no sequence detected.
  2. A single '1' with no sequence detected.
  3. The '101' sequence is detected.
  4. Reset and no sequence detected again.
