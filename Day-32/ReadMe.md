In this Verilog code:

- `clk` is the clock input.
- `reset` is the reset input.
- `x` is the input signal to detect the sequence "101."
- `y` is the output signal that will be '1' when the sequence is detected, and '0' otherwise.

The code defines a 3-bit sequence detector using the Moore model. It has four states (`S0` to `S3`), where `S3` represents the state when the "101" sequence is detected. The output `y` is set to '1' only when the sequence is detected in state `S3`. The FSM transitions through these states based on the input signal `x`. The sequence detector resets to `S0` when the `reset` signal is asserted.

You can instantiate this module in your Verilog design and connect it to your clock, reset, and input signal as needed.
