In this Verilog code:

enable is an input that controls whether the demux is enabled or not. When enable is 1, the demux is active; otherwise, all outputs are set to 0.

select is a 2-bit input that determines which output line will be active based on its binary value. For example, if select is 2'b10, the third output out2 will be active.

out0, out1, out2, and out3 are the four output lines of the demux. One of them will be active based on the value of select when enable is high.

Remember to include this module in your Verilog design hierarchy and connect the inputs and outputs appropriately in your top-level design.
