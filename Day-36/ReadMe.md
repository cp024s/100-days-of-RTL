## In this Verilog module:

- `clk` is the clock signal.
- `rst` is the reset signal.
- `multiplicand` is the 4-bit input multiplicand.
- `multiplier` is the 4-bit input multiplier.
- `product` is the 8-bit output product.

This module implements Booth's algorithm for binary multiplication. It uses an accumulator to keep track of the product and shifts the multiplier and multiplier register rightward as the algorithm progresses. Depending on the bits of the multiplier and the multiplier register, it either adds or subtracts the multiplicand from the accumulator.
