## In this Verilog module:

1. `queue` is an array of 4 registers, representing the LIFO queue. Each register holds 8 bits of data.
2. `top` is a 2-bit register used to keep track of the top element in the queue.
3. The `always` block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock signal and the reset signal.
4. When the reset signal is asserted (`reset` is high), it clears the top pointer and sets all elements in the queue to zero.
5. When the `push` signal is asserted (`push` is high), it checks if there is space in the queue (top < 2'b11) and increments the top pointer to push data into the queue.
6. When the `pop` signal is asserted (`pop` is high), it checks if there are elements in the queue (top > 2'b00), pops data from the queue, and decrements the top pointer.

This Verilog module represents a basic LIFO queue with a fixed size of 4 elements. You can modify the number of elements or the data width to suit your specific requirements.
