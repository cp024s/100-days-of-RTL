## Pseudo Random Sequence Generator

This Verilog module implements a 4-bit LFSR that generates a pseudo-random sequence of 4-bit numbers. The LFSR is clocked by the `clk` signal and can be reset using the `rst` signal. You can initialize it with a non-zero seed value when resetting.

The feedback connections within the `always` block are determined by the LFSR polynomial, which you can customize for different pseudo-random sequences. The polynomial used here is a basic example, and you can replace it with other polynomials to achieve different sequences.

Make sure to integrate this module into your larger Verilog design, connect it to your clock source, and handle the reset signal appropriately. Additionally, for more complex and longer sequences, you might consider using larger LFSR configurations (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit LFSRs) to increase the sequence length.
