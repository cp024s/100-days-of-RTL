## TB to verify unpacked Struct dataType in SV
In this example, the `my_struct_t` struct is defined with two members, `data1` and `data2`. 
The testbench initializes an instance of the struct, sets values for its members, and then calls the `verify_struct` function to check whether the struct members have the expected values.
