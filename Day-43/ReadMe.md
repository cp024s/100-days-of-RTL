## In this Verilog code:

1. We have a module named `ROM` with an 8-bit `address` input and an 8-bit `data` output.
2. The ROM data is defined using an array `rom_data`, where each element corresponds to a memory location.
3. Inside the `initial` block, you can initialize the ROM with your desired values. In the example, I've initialized it with sequential values for demonstration purposes. You should replace these values with your own data.
4. The `always` block continuously updates the `data` output based on the `address` input. It reads the value stored at the specified memory location and assigns it to the `data` output.

You can customize the ROM data by modifying the values in the `initial` block to store the data you need in the ROM.
