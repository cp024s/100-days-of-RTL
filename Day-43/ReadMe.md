## In this Verilog code

1. We have a module named `ROM` with an 8-bit `address` input and an 8-bit `data` output.
2. The ROM data is defined using an array `rom_data`, where each element corresponds to a memory location.
3. Inside the `initial` block, you can initialize the ROM with your desired values. In the example, I've initialized it with sequential values for demonstration purposes. You should replace these values with your own data.
4. The `always` block continuously updates the `data` output based on the `address` input. It reads the value stored at the specified memory location and assigns it to the `data` output.

You can customize the ROM data by modifying the values in the `initial` block to store the data you need in the ROM.

## In this testbench

1. We instantiate the `ROM` module.
2. The `initial` block initializes the testing process and loops through all 256 possible addresses.
3. For each address, you need to specify the expected data value in the `case` statement based on your ROM data.
4. The testbench applies each address to the ROM and compares the actual data output with the expected data.
5. It prints whether the test passed or failed for each address.

You should replace the expected data values in the `case` statement with the correct data values based on your ROM initialization. This testbench provides a basic framework for testing your 8-bit ROM, and you can expand it to cover all 256 addresses with their respective expected data.
