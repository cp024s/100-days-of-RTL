# 4x1 MUX 
In this Verilog module, data_inputs is a 4-bit input bus representing the data inputs to the multiplexer, and select is a 2-bit input bus representing the selection lines. The mux_output is the output of the multiplexer.

The assign statement is used to create conditional assignments based on the values of the select lines. Depending on the value of the select lines, the appropriate data input is selected and assigned to the mux_output.

Remember to include this module in your Verilog design hierarchy and connect it to the desired signals and components.


# 4x1 MUX using 2x1 MUX
In this implementation, we first create a 2x1 multiplexer module (mux_2x1) that takes two data inputs (data0 and data1), a select signal (select), and produces an output mux_output.

Then, we create the 4x1 multiplexer module (mux_4x1_using_2x1) which uses two instances of the 2x1 multiplexer to achieve the functionality of a 4x1 multiplexer. The mux_4x1_using_2x1 module takes four data inputs (data_inputs), a 2-bit select signal (select), and produces the final mux_output.

The intermediate_select signal is used to pass the select signal from the main module to the intermediate muxes (mux0 and mux1).

Please note that you need to instantiate the mux_4x1_using_2x1 module in your Verilog design hierarchy and connect it to the desired signals and components.
