In this Verilog module, data_inputs is a 4-bit input bus representing the data inputs to the multiplexer, and select is a 2-bit input bus representing the selection lines. The mux_output is the output of the multiplexer.

The assign statement is used to create conditional assignments based on the values of the select lines. Depending on the value of the select lines, the appropriate data input is selected and assigned to the mux_output.

Remember to include this module in your Verilog design hierarchy and connect it to the desired signals and components.
