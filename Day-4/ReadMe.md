# Overview <br/>
This repository contains the design and implementation of a 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). An ALU is a fundamental component in digital circuits that performs various arithmetic and logical operations on binary data. The ALU presented here is capable of executing the following operations:
<br/> <br/>

# Operations <br/>
Addition<br/>
Subtraction<br/>
Multiplication<br/>
One's Complement<br/>
Bitwise AND <br/>
Bitwise OR <br/>
Bitwise NOT <br/> <br/>
The ALU has been designed for educational purposes and as a demonstration of basic digital logic design principles. It is intended to provide a clear and simple example of how these operations can be implemented in hardware.
