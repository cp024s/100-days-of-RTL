## In this enhanced Verilog code:

- There is an `enable` signal that can be used to enable or disable the priority encoding process.
- An `asynchronous clear` signal (`clear`) has been added to reset the output to zero when activated.
- The `case` statement is used to determine the highest-priority input.
- The default case handles situations where no input is active.

Creating a testbench with all possible combinations for an 8-to-3 priority encoder would involve generating all 256 input combinations and checking the corresponding output values. While manually creating all those combinations can be quite extensive, I can provide you with a simplified testbench that covers some test cases. You can expand on this testbench to include more combinations if needed.

## In this testbench:

- The testbench generates all 256 possible input combinations for the 8-bit input bus `inputs`.
- The `enable` signal is set to 1 to enable the priority encoder, and the `clear` signal is set to 0.
- The simulation iterates through all input combinations, applying each combination and displaying the input and output values.

Please note that simulating all possible input combinations can be time-consuming, and this testbench provides a simplified coverage of the test cases. Depending on your requirements, you may expand the testbench to cover additional test cases or use automated testing tools to handle exhaustive testing more efficiently.
