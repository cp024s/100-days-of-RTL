## In this enhanced Verilog code:

- There is an `enable` signal that can be used to enable or disable the priority encoding process.
- An `asynchronous clear` signal (`clear`) has been added to reset the output to zero when activated.
- The `case` statement is used to determine the highest-priority input.
- The default case handles situations where no input is active.
