## The code consists of three pipeline stages:

1. **Stage 1:** Captures the input data when a positive edge of the clock signal occurs or when a reset is asserted.

2. **Stage 2:** Performs the shift operation based on the control signals `shift_amount` and `shift_right`.

3. **Stage 3:** Captures the shifted data from Stage 2.

You'll need to provide the clock signal and reset signal as inputs to the module. Additionally, you may want to customize this code further based on your specific requirements, such as adding more pipeline stages or handling different shift amounts and input widths.
