## In this Verilog code:

1. We define the states (S0, S1, S2, S3) that the FSM can be in.
2. We create state transition logic in the first `always` block, which updates the `state` based on the current state and the input `data_in`. The FSM starts in state S0 when reset is asserted and transitions through the states as it detects the sequence "101."
3. We have another `always` block that determines when the sequence is detected (state S3), setting the `detected` output high.
4. The module has inputs for `clk`, `reset`, and `data_in`, and an output `detected` that indicates when the sequence is detected.

To use this module, you would need to instantiate it in your top-level design and connect the `clk`, `reset`, `data_in`, and `detected` signals accordingly.
