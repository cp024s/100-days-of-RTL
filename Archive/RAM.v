Creating a basic RAM (Random Access Memory) module using Verilog typically involves defining a memory array and specifying the read and write operations. Here's an example of a simple 8x8 RAM module in Verilog:

```verilog
module simple_ram (
  input wire clk,       // Clock input
  input wire write_en,  // Write enable signal
  input wire [2:0] addr, // Address input (3 bits for 8 locations)
  input wire [7:0] data_in, // Data input (8 bits)
  output wire [7:0] data_out // Data output (8 bits)
);

  reg [7:0] memory [0:7]; // 8x8 RAM array

  // Read operation
  assign data_out = (write_en) ? data_in : memory[addr];

  // Write operation
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (write_en) begin
      memory[addr] <= data_in;
    end
  end

endmodule
```
/*
In this Verilog code:

- `clk` is the clock signal used for synchronous operation.
- `write_en` is the write enable signal that controls whether to perform a write operation.
- `addr` is the address input used to select the memory location.
- `data_in` is the data input to be written into the memory.
- `data_out` is the data output read from the selected memory location.

The RAM is implemented as an array named `memory`, where each element represents an 8-bit location. The read operation selects the data from the addressed location or writes data to the addressed location based on the value of `write_en`. The write operation is synchronous and occurs on the positive edge of the clock.

You can instantiate this module in your top-level Verilog design and connect it to your clock signal, write enable signal, address input, data input, and data output as needed.

Remember that this is a simplified example of a RAM module. Real-world RAM modules may have more features, such as additional addressing modes, wider data buses, and more complex control logic.
