A clock generator in Verilog is typically used to generate clock signals with specific frequencies and duty cycles. Below is an example of a simple clock generator module that generates a clock signal with a 50% duty cycle and a specified frequency. The frequency is determined by dividing the clock source's frequency by a divisor value.

module clock_generator (
    input wire clk_source,     // Clock source input
    input wire rst,            // Reset input
    output wire clk_out        // Generated clock output
);

  reg [15:0] counter;         // 16-bit counter to divide the clock

  // Clock Divider Logic
  always @(posedge clk_source or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
      counter <= 16'b0;       // Reset the counter to 0
    end else begin
      // Increment the counter on each clock edge
      counter <= counter + 1;
    end
  end

  // Clock Output Logic (Toggle on reaching half of the counter range)
  assign clk_out = (counter == 16'b1000000000000000) ? ~clk_out : clk_out;

endmodule


  
/*
In this code:

- `clk_source` is the input clock source that you want to divide to generate the new clock signal.
- `rst` is a reset signal to reset the counter.
- `clk_out` is the generated clock output.

The module divides the input `clk_source` frequency by 65536 (2^16) since it's a 16-bit counter. When the counter reaches half of its range, it toggles the output, creating a 50% duty cycle.

You can instantiate this module in your top-level Verilog design and connect it to an external clock source to generate a clock signal with a different frequency or use a frequency synthesizer module to generate custom clock frequencies.
